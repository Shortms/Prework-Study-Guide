# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I created this project as part of my Prework for a course in Front End Web Development. It is a study guide for people doing the course,with some notes on what I have learnt.
This webpage is the first time I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a website and Git to sync the local repository on my computer with a GitHub repository.
It helped me to understand how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to create a structured website which has been customised and added interactivity.

## Usage

The page is split into 3 sections for the topics studied in the Prework. HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, respectively.
Each section has some notes oneach topic.

At the top of the page below the Header, the user is instructed to open the console. You can do this by opening the ChromeDevTools.
Right click anywhere on the page and select 'Inspect' in the menu which pops up. This will open ChromeDevTools. Then click on 'console' tab.
You can also open to the console directly by pressing Command+Option+I on Mac or Control-Shift-I on Windows.

In this console, the user will see the topics explored in the Prework and a suggestion on which topic to study.
